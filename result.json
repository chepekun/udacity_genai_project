{"question": "What problems did Apollo 13 encounter?", "documents": ["[apollo_13: 1970-04-11 19:21:45]\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. Mark level sense arm.\nJim: Mark level sense arm. Roger.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. At 9 minutes, you are GO; the Command module computer is GO.\nJoe: Okay, Joe.\nJim: 13; Roger.\nHouston: 13, Houston. You are GO for staging.\nJim: 13; Roger. GO for staging.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. Stand by for mode IV capability.\nHouston: MARK\nHouston: You have mode IV, Jim.\nJim: Mode IV. Roger. Staging.\nHouston: Roger. Staging.\nJim: And S-IV ignition, Houston.\nHouston: Roger that, Jim. Thrust looks good.\nJim: Roger.\nHouston: 13, Houston. You're looking good. Trajectory, guidance , Command module computer are all GO .\nJim: Thank you, Joe.\nHouston: 13, Housto. At 11 minutes, you're GO. Predieted cut-off on the S-IVB is 12 plus 34. Over.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. You're GO at 11-1/2, and predicted cut-off time is 12 plus 34. Over.\nJim: understand; 12 plus 34 predicted cut-off time.\nHouston: That's affirm.\nJim: SECO.\nHouston: Copy SECO, Jim. We're looking at the Display and keyboard.\nJim: Roger.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. You have a GO orbit all sources, and the booster is safe. Over.\nJim: GO orbit and the booster is safe. Thank you, Joe.\nHouston: Don't mention it.\nHouston: 13, Houston. We copy your NOUN 44.\nJoe: Okay, Joe.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. Your preliminary orbit down here is 102.5 times 100.3, and everything is looking good.\nJim: Roger, Houston. And it looks good to be up here again.\nHouston: I'll bet.\nHouston: 13, Houston. I have your Z torquing angles. You ready?\nJim: Jack is ready to copy, Joe.\nHouston: Okay. It's plus 0.26. Over.\nJoe: Okay, Joe. Plus 0.26.\nHouston: That's Roger.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston.\nJim: Go ahead, Houston.\nHouston: Okay. Couple minutes to Loss of signal/line of sight, Jim. Everything is looking real good. Your Acquisition of signal time at Carnarvon will be 52:36, and we don't have too much of a handle on why the inboard cut off early except that it apparently was an engine problem and not a switch-select function. But we are certain that you'll be able to make Translunar injection based on what we are looking at now.\nJim: Roger. There's nothing like an interesting launch.\nHouston: That' s right.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. Canary Loss of signal/line of sight in 30 seconds. Request COMMAND RESET, please.\nJim: Roger. COMMAND RESET coming on.\nHouston: Thank you.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. Request LOW BIT RATE, please. Over.", "[apollo_13: 1970-04-17 18:04:18]\nRecovery: Apollo 13, Apollo 13, this is Recovery. Over.\nRecovery: Apollo 13 - -\nJoe: Go ahead.\nJoe: - - see you loud and clear going throug 5000\nRecovery: Roger, Apollo 13. This is Recovery and chutes look good.\nRecovery: Apollo 13, this is Recovery. We observed your Reaction control system burn. Over.\nRecovery: This is Recovery. Apollo 13 is descending through 2000 feet.\nRecovery: Okay. Our altimeter concurs.\nRecovery: Iwo Jima; Roger. Out.\nRecovery: Apollo 13 and Recovery passing through 1000 feet.\nRecovery: Iwo Jima; Roger.\nRecovery: Through 500 feet.\nRecovery: Swim 1 on station.\nRecovery: - - 2 is on station.\nRecovery: Photo l's on station. Photo 1 observes splashdown at this time.\nRecovery: 1 ... pickup ...\nRecovery: Roger.\nRecovery: Photo-1. Splashdown at this time. The three chutes are displaced. They're in the water.\nRecovery: ... Recovery, I have a clock - -", "[apollo_13: 1970-04-11 20:54:18]\nHouston: Roger, Fred. Readback correct, and we're getting a nice coder TV picture now. lf you have any commentary to go with it..\nJoe: Okay, Joe. I'll tell you I'm just trying to figure out where we are here.\nHouston: That's your job, not mine.\nJoe: You know, I've just been up out of the Lower equipment bay for a short time here, and I'm trying to find out which country we're over.\nJim: I have to keep telling Jack that blue stuff down there is water.\nHouston: I'll give you a hint. You're in the western hemisphere .\nJoe: Okay, Joe. It appears like that we've crossed out into the Gulf of Mexico here, and I've got a peninsuia or an island that's down there. I don't know whether you can see it.\nHouston: Roger, Jack. We see that. Of course, there's a lot of cloudcover and you see it more clearly than we do, but it does look like the Earth, not the Moon.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. We've had Loss of signal/line of sight MILA now. Thank you very much.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT for a state vector. Over.\nJim: Roger, Houston. We're in P00 and ACCEPT.\nHouston: Okay.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston.\nJim: Go ahead, Houston.\nHouston: Okay. The computer is yours, Jim.\nJim: Thank you, - -\nHouston: And you are GO for Translunar injection. Huntsville reperts that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is 3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're good on consumabies . The Instrument unit is so good that we're not going to update it. The only change we have for you is in the Translunar injection checkiist. At 57 minutes where you slew the Flight director attitude indicator to 18 degrees, we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees at ignition. The S_IVB is riding on the top of its deadband.\nJim: - - understand; and just out of curiosity was that engine out to use up more S-IVB fuel?\nHouston: The engine out did cause you to use more S-IVB fuel - about a 10-second-longer burn; but you're still GO.\nJim: Okay. Thank you.\nHouston: And, 13, Houston. We're ready to support pyro arm and docking probe extension whenever you're ready.\nJim: Okay, Houston. Docking probe has been extended and all indications are nominal. We're down to PYR0 ARM now and we're getting ready.", "[apollo_13: 1970-04-12 19:35:01]\nJim: Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the pad.\nHouston: Okay. Ground elapsed time of ignition is 035:00, DELTA-VT 7883, Longitude minus 155, and the Ground elapsed time 400K 069:54. Over.\nJim: Ground elapsed time of ignition is 035:00, 7883, minus 155, 069:54.\nHouston: Okay.\nJim: And, Houston, Jack's going to try donning his suit now for practice, himself, and when he gets it out, we'll give you a dosimeter reading.\nHouston: Okay. Real good.\nJim: Houston, Apollo 13.\nHouston: 13, Houston. Go.\nJim: Okay. We've retrieved Jack's dosimeter, and it's reading 02022.\nHouston: Okay. We copy 02022 on the dosimeter, Jim.\nJim: That's affirm.\nHouston: 13, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like the Lunar module/Command module DELTA-P reading.\nJim: That reading is 0.65 psi.\nHouston: Copy 0.65. Thank you.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston.\nJim: Houston, Apol ... Roger. We're thinking together. And we're here waiting for your call.\nHouston: Okay, you were a little broken up there, Jim, hut I think it's getting better. We are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are.\nJim: Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. You were cut out again; say again, please.\nHouston: Roger, Jim. We are ready for the launch-vehicle- systems debriefing whenever you are. Over.\nJim: Okay. Stand by 1.\nJim: Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to question 1, the changes in noise level occurred mainly between the first stags and the other stages - the other stages were about the same in noise level, very quiet, with the first stage, of course, making quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which built up during the high Q, and then ... went quiet just after high Q.\nHouston: Okay, copy that, Jim.\nJim: I might mention that the noise level during the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all.\nHouston: Roger. And I assume COMM was okay.\nJim: That's affirm. COMM was very good all during - throughout the entire flight. Much better than I expected.\nHouston: Okay.\nJim: Now, in answer to question 2, there was, of course, a vibration transient in the second stage that - due to the number 5 engine going out - which occurred shortly before the engine went out, and slightly after that then the S-II stage was very smooth.\nHouston: Okay, Jim. I guess the significant point there is that you didn't notice the vibration before you saw the engine light.", "[apollo_13: 1970-04-13 05:16:24]\nHouston: No - -\nJoe: I could get a complex.\nHouston: No. You know - you know how the FIDOs are. They like to load in their own data, no matter what.\nJoe: But our state vectors take into account the waste water dumps.\nHouston: Yes, that's -\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston. It's your computer again.\nJoe: Okay. Going to BLOCK.\nHouston: And as a matter of interest, understand that the downrange comparison between the Mission Control Center/midcourse correction and the computer is within 35000 feet, and that's on the last sighting, which people think is pretty good.\nJoe: Okay. Maybe that gives us a little more confi- dence that if we had to do P23s on the way home, we'd make it.\nHouston: No doubt about it.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston.\nJim: Go ahead, Houston.\nHouston: Just info on your Passive thermal control, Jim. It's looking very good. Just - excursions in pitch and yaw are very low.\nJim: Okay, thank you. And we're going to change another lithium hydroxide canister now.\nHouston: Okay.\nJoe: And, Vance. Has FIDO come up with any obser- vations on the trajectory?\nHouston: Well, a minute ago, he said that to tell you that he was pacified now after your past comments on his trajectory and so forth, and he hadn't seen any waste water dumps or anything and he's pretty happy.\nJoe: Okay. I just wondered if we're going to need any more midcourse.\nHouston: He says, seriously, it's looking probably like you won't have any more.\nJoe: Hey, that's real fine.\nHouston: FIDOs never guarantee anything, however.\nJoe: Yes. That's right.\nJoe: Houston, 13. I have the onboard read-out, if you're ready to copy.\nHouston: Roger. Go ahead.\nJoe: Okay. BAT C 37, PYRO BAT A 37, PYR0 BAT B 37, Reaction control system A 97 percent, B 97 percent, C 96 percent, D 97 percent.\nHouston: Roger. We copy that. Thank you.\nHouston: Apollo 13, Houston.\nJim: Go ahead, Vance.\nHouston: Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. These conservative people would like to have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go into the Lunar module for the Lunar module familiarization at 58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the Lunar module familiarization up from $8 to 55 hours. Over."], "answer": "During the Apollo 13 mission, the crew encountered several problems that ultimately led to a critical situation in space. One of the main issues was an explosion in the Service Module oxygen tank, which caused a loss of oxygen and electrical power. This forced the crew to abort their planned lunar landing and focus on returning safely to Earth. The crew had to rely on the Lunar Module as a lifeboat, conserving power, water, and other essential resources to ensure their survival during the journey back home.\n\nThe crew also faced challenges with the spacecraft's systems, such as limited power supply, high levels of carbon dioxide, and the need to make improvised repairs to ensure their safe return. The teamwork, ingenuity, and determination of the crew, along with the support from Mission Control, were crucial in overcoming these obstacles and successfully bringing the astronauts back to Earth.\n\nThe Apollo 13 mission is a testament to the resilience and resourcefulness of the astronauts and the ground team in the face of unexpected challenges in space exploration.", "metrics": {"faithfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "answer_relevancy": NaN}}
