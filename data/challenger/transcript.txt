Doesn't it go the other way?

000:00:26 MS1
Now I see it; I see it.

000:00:26 PLT
God I hope not Ellison.

000:00:27 MS1
I couldn't see it moving; it was behind the center screen.

000:00:28 NASA
Obstructed view of liquid oxygen supply arm.

000:00:28 NASA
Seat restraints.

000:00:36 PLT
What for?

000:00:37 CDR
I won't lock mine; I might have to reach something.

000:00:41 PLT
Ooh kaaaay.

000:01:01 MS1
Dick's thinking of somebody there.

000:01:02 CDR
Unhuh.

000:01:06 CDR
One minute downstairs.

000:01:07 NASA
One minute till launch.

000:01:13 MS2
Cabin Pressure is probably going to give us an alarm.

000:01:15 CDR
OK.

000:01:18 CDR
OK there.

000:01:22 PLT
Alarm looks good.

000:01:23 NASA
Cabin pressure is acceptable.

000:01:23 CDR
OK.

000:01:25 PLT
Ullage pressures are up.

000:01:26 NASA
External tank ullage pressure.

000:01:31 PLT
Right engine helium tank is just a little bit low.

000:01:32 NASA
SSME supply helium pressure.

000:01:33 CDR
It was yesterday, too.

000:01:34 PLT
OK.

000:01:35 CDR
Thirty seconds down there.

000:01:36 NASA
30 seconds till launch.

000:01:40 PLT
Remember the red button when you make a roll call.

000:01:41 NASA
Precautionary reminder for communications configuration.

000:01:42 CDR
I won't do that; thanks a lot.

000:01:50 CDR
Fifteen.

000:01:51 NASA
15 seconds till launch.

000:01:59 CDR
There they go guys.

000:02:00 NASA
SSME Ignition.

000:02:00 NASA
SSME thrust level at 100% for all 3 engines.

000:02:05 MS2
Aaall riiight.

000:02:06 PLT
Here we go.

000:02:07 NASA
Vehicle motion.

000:02:12 CDR
Houston, Challenger roll program.

000:02:13 NASA
Initiation of vehicle roll program.

000:02:16 PLT
Go you Mother.

LVLH.

000:02:20 MS2
(Expletive) hot.

000:02:21 CDR
Ooohh-kaaay.

000:02:24 PLT
Looks like we've got a lotta wind here today.

000:02:25 CDR
Yeah.

000:02:27 CDR
It's a little hard to see out my window here.

000:02:33 PLT
There's ten thousand feet and Mach point five.

000:02:34 NASA
Altitude and velocity report.

000:02:40 CDR
Point nine.

There's Mach one.

000:02:46 CDR
Going through nineteen thousand.

000:02:47 NASA
Altitude report, 19,000 ft.

000:02:48 CDR
OK we're throttling down.

000:02:49 NASA
Normal SSME thrust reduction during maximum dynamic pressure region.

000:03:02 CDR
Throttling up.

000:03:03 NASA
Throttle up to 104% after maximum dynamic pressure.
